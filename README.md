# Artificial-Intelligence
Projects involving AI.

This directory contains all the assignments I completed while participating in an Erasmus+ exchange program at Charles University in Prague. I was enrolled in Roman Bart√°k PhD's AI 1 NAIL069 course. All the credit for the games' implementation goes to the academics and the faculty. My contributions to every game were the Agent class and the AI search method. The sections from the original README that follow are:

# AI I
This repository contains practical tasks for the [Artificial Intelligence 1](http://ktiml.mff.cuni.cz/~bartak/ui/) course, that is based on book by Russel and Norvig [Artificial Intellignece: A Modern Approach, 4th Edition](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Russell-Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach-4th-Edition/PGM1263338.html). Tasks are designed to review AI algorithms and use them to play games.

## Requirements
All assignments will be written in python. Task were created for python 3.9 however there should not be any problems with backward compatibility. You can solve all assignments while working exclusively with python standard library, however for game visualizations you will need to install modul [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).
For installation you can use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

    python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user

If you need more detailed, platform-specific instructions you can visit [pygame-GettingStarted](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).
